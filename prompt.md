we're building an iphone app for mens division 1 college lacrosse scores.  it shall allow discovery of upcoming games by day across mens D1 teams to start, and live scores on gamedays as well, as well as future games via calendar that's out of the way but easy to use.  it should use the latest liquid glass Apple design conventions only as it were natively designed by the apple UX team and engineers - but should also feel like its designed for modern mobile teenagers who are used to fast, data heavy interafces. 

- Each game should include offical school logos and pertinent pre game info like time, date, team rankings, location,
-should have a dark mode and light mode automatically set via the OS.  

- lets craete a native , Swift UI based iphone and ipad app

- as a world calss design agency looking to break out with an apple deisgn award with this app, deeply think about how to please fans and win with design here, incluing composition, color, animation, delight and surprise for rthe audience.  

-feel free to propose features to advance the concept and make it stand out.  

data for live scoring and schedule should come from the NCAA API, but also will need to be backfilled in with reliable content for schedule infomration , and especially for timely live game updates and box score stats, and player info and team info.  You can build a screaper and store a master database for us from :
https://stats.statbroadcast.com/scoreboard/index.html?confid=acc&theme=accgamecenter&confonly=1&sport=lcgame&gender=M&conflive=1

and the following as an in game version:
https://stats.statbroadcast.com/broadcast/?id=649161&confid=acc

they layout should be data rich, dark themed , twitchy , made for teenage and college aged passionate lacrosse fans.  The college logos are the hero of the story here., but the game details , its updates and events should feel alive and as exciting as the sport. 

When making front end design decisions its important you read , reasearch and absorb all of the infortiaon in the @UI-guidelines.md file - this should be a critical part of how the app gets planned and ultimaltey built to product a modern, award winning effect.
