<objective>
Human verification checkpoint: confirm the completed scoreboard looks and feels correct on a real iOS 26 simulator before Phase 3 is marked complete.

Purpose: Automated tests cover data correctness but cannot verify visual quality, animation smoothness, or overall feel. This checkpoint ensures the phase goal — "Users open the app and instantly see every D1 lacrosse game for any date" — is met in practice.

Output: User approval (or issue list for gap closure).

  <what-built>
    Complete Phase 3 Scoreboard:
    - Real game data fetched from backend API at launch
    - Stacked away/home game cards with team logos, scores, period info
    - Status-sorted sections: LIVE, UPCOMING, FINAL
    - Final games collapse after 3 with expand button
    - Horizontal date strip showing only dates with games
    - Monthly calendar half-sheet with dot indicators (calendar icon in nav bar)
    - Custom lacrosse ball pull-to-refresh animation
    - Loading skeleton, empty state ("Sorry folks, no ball scheduled today."), and error state
    - Blinking red dot on live game cards
    - Liquid Glass tab bar and navigation chrome from Phase 2 still intact
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    Build and run on the iOS 26 simulator:
    ```
    xcodebuild build -project BarDown-iOS/BarDown.xcodeproj -scheme BarDown -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro'
    open -a Simulator
    ```
    Then launch BarDown in the simulator.

    Check each item:
    1. **Launch state**: App opens to Scores tab. Either game cards appear (if API is running + has data) OR loading skeleton appears briefly, then empty/error state. Both are correct depending on backend availability.
    2. **Card layout**: Each card shows away team on top, home team on bottom. Score or start time in center. Team logos present (or placeholder icon if no logos configured).
    3. **Date strip**: Visible below nav bar. Shows date labels. Tapping a date updates the game list.
    4. **Calendar sheet**: Tap the calendar icon (top right). Half-sheet slides up. Navigate months with chevrons. Dates with games show accent dot indicator. Tap a game date to jump to it.
    5. **Pull to refresh**: Pull down on the game list. A white lacrosse ball bounces with shadow below (NOT the default iOS spinner). Release or wait for refresh to complete.
    6. **Section headers**: If multiple game states exist, LIVE/UPCOMING/FINAL section headers appear.
    7. **Final collapse**: If more than 3 final games, first 3 show with "Show X more final games" button below.
    8. **Tab bar**: Liquid Glass tab bar still present at bottom. Other tabs still navigate correctly.
    9. **Dark mode**: App is in dark mode by default (Phase 2 decision). Game cards are opaque (not glassed).
    10. **Live indicator**: Any live game should have a small blinking red dot visible on the card.
